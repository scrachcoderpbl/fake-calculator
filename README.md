# Fake Calculator Prank App (Python)

A simple calculator app built in Python that works like a normal calculator… until it doesn’t

This project is designed purely for harmless fun and learning purposes.

The application behaves like a regular calculator:

- Performs basic arithmetic operations

- Accepts user input

After several successful operations, it unexpectedly displays a fake system error message to prank the user and prints the command that is for shutting down in the terminal



#IMPORTANT

This program does NOT actually harm the system, delete files, or shut down the computer. It only simulates an error message for comedic effect.

Make sure Python 3 is installed.

#Disclaimer

This project is intended strictly for educational purposes and harmless entertainment.
Do not use software to deceive, disrupt or harm other users.
